## Wedding/Event Planner Pain Points — Sorted by Severity & Frequency

### TIER 1: Daily Agony (Every Planner, Every Event)

1. **Vendor follow-up black hole** — Constantly chasing vendors for responses, no single view of who's ghosting you this week
2. **"What's waiting on the client" invisibility** — Can't easily show clients the 7 decisions blocking progress
3. **Client approval amnesia** — "You never told me that!" No audit trail of what they approved and when
4. **Contact info scattered everywhere** — Vendor details across emails, texts, spreadsheets, business cards, Instagram DMs
5. **Task overload without dependencies** — 300+ tasks but no way to show "can't do X until Y is done"
6. **Multi-event overwhelm** — Managing 15+ active weddings, can't see "what needs attention TODAY across all events"
7. **Timeline changes = notify everyone manually** — One change means texting/emailing 10+ vendors individually
8. **Budget tracking nightmare** — "How much do we have left?" requires 30 minutes of spreadsheet archaeology
9. **Email thread graveyard** — Critical decisions buried in 50-reply threads, unsearchable

### TIER 2: Weekly Frustration (Most Planners, Most Events)

10. **Deposit/payment tracking across 20+ vendors** — Which deposits are due when? What's paid vs. pending?
11. **Day-of timeline too complex for any tool** — 100+ line items, parallel tracks, minute-level coordination
12. **Document chaos** — Contracts, inspiration photos, floor plans scattered across 5 platforms
13. **Client communication preferences mismatch** — They text, you email, vendor calls, nothing syncs
14. **Headcount ripple effect** — RSVP changes affect catering, seating, rentals, cake servings... manually
15. **Template reuse is manual** — Every wedding needs the same 200 tasks but you copy-paste every time
16. **Vendor arrival coordination** — Florist needs 3 hours, caterer needs 2, venue allows one load-in door
17. **Who owns this task?** — Client, planner, or vendor? Accountability unclear
18. **Internal notes vs. client-visible status** — No way to share progress without exposing "vendor being difficult"
19. **Client decision-maker chaos** — Bride approved, but mother-in-law is paying and disagrees

### TIER 3: Monthly Pain (Frequent, Solvable)

20. **Vendor performance tracking** — "Was this florist good?" No history across past events
21. **Contract/insurance expiration tracking** — Vendor's insurance expired, you find out day-of
22. **Recurring check-ins aren't tasks** — "Confirm with caterer monthly" doesn't fit task model
23. **Dietary restrictions flow** — Guest allergies must reach caterer, baker, venue—manually forwarded
24. **Budget estimate vs. actual drift** — Hidden fees (cake cutting, corkage) surprise everyone
25. **Rehearsal dinner as separate-but-linked event** — Different timeline, some same vendors, tools don't connect
26. **Post-event tasks forgotten** — Final payments, vendor reviews, photo delivery follow-up
27. **Seasonal/weather contingency** — Outdoor venue needs Plan B, no good way to track parallel plans
28. **Last-minute client changes after vendor booked** — No change history, no impact tracking
29. **Team handoff** — Assistant needs context, lead planner leaves, day-of coordinator needs different view

### TIER 4: Periodic Annoyance (Real but Manageable)

30. **Day-of real-time updates** — Paper timeline obsolete by hour 2, no live update mechanism
31. **Profitability per event unknown** — How many hours did this wedding actually take?
32. **Seating chart ripple** — One change affects place cards, escort display, catering diagram
33. **Guest gift/thank-you tracking** — Who sent what, has thank-you been sent?
34. **VIP guest special handling** — Grandmother needs wheelchair access, divorced parents can't sit near each other
35. **Permits/licenses by jurisdiction** — Different rules per venue type, no reminder system
36. **Booking window awareness** — Top photographers book 18 months out, no lead time visibility
37. **Multi-day destination complexity** — Welcome party → ceremony → brunch, dependencies across days
38. **Vendor meal/parking passes** — Always forgotten until day-of
39. **Emergency contact accessibility** — Day-of crisis, can't find vendor's cell number quickly
40. **Shot list management** — Photo/video must-haves that grow over time, no version control

### TIER 5: Nice-to-Have (Differentiators)

41. **Lead-to-booking pipeline** — CRM functionality for sales process
42. **Client "temperature check"** — Relationship health tracking
43. **Vendor portal access** — Let vendors see their tasks without seeing full event
44. **Revenue seasonality forecasting** — When to market, when to rest
45. **Time tracking per event** — For pricing future events accurately
46. **Portfolio event flagging** — Which weddings to feature in marketing
47. **Currency conversion** — Destination wedding vendor payments
48. **Gratuity tracking** — Recommended tips per vendor category
49. **Client questionnaire integration** — Preference docs linked to relevant tasks
50. **Inspiration asset organization** — Pinterest, Instagram, magazines in one place with tags
